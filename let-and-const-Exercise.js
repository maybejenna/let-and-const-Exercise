// ## **Quiz**

// - What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
//     the var keyword scopes a variable to that function. 
//     It hoists to the top of the scope it is defined in. 
//     You can redeclare it and reasign its value. 

//     the let keyword is a block-scoped variable, so it only exists inside a code block. 
//     It can be reassigned but not redeclared. 

// - What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
//     the var keyword scopes a variable to that function. 
//     It hoists to the top of the scope it is defined in. 
//     You can redeclare it and reasign its value. 
//     It can be mutated

//     the const keyword is a block-scoped variable, so it only exists inside a code block. 
//     It can NEVER be reassigned but not redeclared. 
//     It can be mutated

// - What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
//     let can be reassigned or redeclared.
//     const CANNOT be reassigned or redeclared.

// - What is hoisting?
//     Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which variable and function declarations are 
//     moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
//     This means that variables and functions are accessible before their actual declaration in the code.
